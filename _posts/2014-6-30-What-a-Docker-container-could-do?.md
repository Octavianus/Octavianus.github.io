It must enable complex enterprise applications in the cloud, much as VMware vApp simplifies the deployment of multitier applications; have more user-friendly graphical user interfaces for easy management; and provide more debugging and tracing features." One of the potential attractions of CoreOS, then, is how it might offer many of those very features in the form of a Linux stack.

Provide a mount point to the container file system.
docker run -t -i -v /home/vagrant/mp:/home/vagrant/script 6eb7977eea28 python ~/script/test.py

Mount point and the interactive feature in the docker container. Also you can expose your container to the network by assigning a port.
