To setup a bluetooth headset such as __LG HBS 730__ to a windows 7 laptop, you just need to follow the steps below :

* 1.The first thing to do is to open your laptop bluetooth.
* 2.On dell laptop you need to press FN + F2 and it will prompt and on and off option for bluetooth.
* 3.Then Go to Start Menu - > Devices and Printers.
* 4.On the upper left part of the screen you will see `add a device` Click on it.
* 5.It will search for a device.
* 6.Get your bluetooth headset.
* 7.Turn on the bluetooth and wait for the light to turn blue.
* 8.Your laptop will detect the bluetooth headset.
* 9.On your laptop select the bluetooth headset and click next.
* 10.Then finish the setup.
* `11`.The next thing to do is to go on your computer control panel - > then go to sound - > go to playback - > And select your bluetooth headset - > then set it `as default`.

step 11 is the critical step that most of us have forgotten for connection.
If it is already set as default or if it is already working then skip the last step.
After that, our device should hear the sound from our laptop now, if you have a microphone on your headset, it also should work if you follow all the steps.
